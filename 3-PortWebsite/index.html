									<h2><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40091-017-0152-2" target="_blank">Reconstruction and analysis of hybrid composite shells using meshless methods</a></h2>
										<h3>International Journal of Advanced Structural Engineering - 30/01/17</h3>
										<h3>G.M.S. Bernardo, M.A.R. Loja</h3>
										<h4>Abstract:</h4>
										<p>The importance of focusing on the research of viable models to predict the behaviour of structures which may possess in some cases complex geometries 
											is an issue that is growing in different scientiﬁc areas, ranging from the civil and mechanical engineering to the architecture or biomedical devices
											 ﬁelds. In these cases, the research effort to ﬁnd an efﬁcient approach to ﬁt laser scanning point clouds, to the desired surface, has been 
											 increasing, leading to the possibility of modelling as-built/as-is structures and components’ features. However, combining the task of surface 
											 reconstruction and the implementation of a structural analysis model is not a trivial task. Although there are works focusing those different phases 
											 in separate, there is still an effective need to ﬁnd approaches able to interconnect them in an efﬁcient way. Therefore, achieving a representative 
											 geometric model able to be subsequently submitted to a structural analysis in a similar based platform is a fundamental step to establish an 
											 effective expeditious processing workﬂow. With the present work, one presents an integrated methodology based on the use of meshless approaches, 
											 to reconstruct shells described by points’ clouds, and to subsequently predict their static behaviour. These methods are highly appropriate on
											  dealing with unstructured points clouds, as they do not need to have any speciﬁc spatial or geometric requirement when implemented, depending 
											  only on the distance between the points. Details on the formulation, and a set of illustrative examples focusing the reconstruction of cylindrical 
											  and double-curvature shells, and its further analysis, are presented.</p>

										<h3>Engineering Structures - 15/12/16</h3>
										<h3>G.M.S. Bernardo, J.A. Rodrigues, M.A.R. Loja</h3>
										<h4>Abstract:</h4>
										<p>Conservation and rehabilitation of structures such as urban buildings and heritage requires a growing effort on the establishment of sufficiently comprehensive documentation 
										concerning the time evolution of these structures’ characteristics and health condition. These documentation archives and databases should be much more than just a collection 
										of structure’s design plans, and desirably they should contain information about the as-built and as-is states of a certain structure. Due to the technological evolution of data 
										acquisition systems, 3D laser scanning points’ clouds became an important data source that enables the subsequent representation of 3D surface’s geometries, and thus the 
										constitution of data repositories. However, it is known that the volume of data obtained, can be enormous and the computation time to process it, a heavy task. The present 
										work proposes an expeditious, continuous processing methodology that aims in a first step the generation of a points’ structured grid and its associated triangle structured 
										mesh by defining an injective function from a virtual surface onto the surface’s cloud points. The additional possibility of selecting the virtual grid dimension to be used, 
										enable representations with different levels of detail. In a second step, the resulting structured grids are used to reconstruct the corresponding surfaces by considering 
										compactly-supported radial basis functions. The main contribution of this work is thus related to the proposal of an expeditious integrated processing methodology of points’ 
										clouds. A set of case studies are presented to illustrate the performance of the present integrated methodology.</p>

										<h3>Composite Structures - 28/04/16</h3>

										<h4>Abstract:</h4>
										<p>Functionally graded materials are characterised by a determined spatial composition variation of their phases’ constituents,

											to ensure a less abrupt variation profile of their properties. Also, depending on the nature of the applications, it may be 
											important to consider a sandwich configuration, where the three-layered constitution may correspond to a functional requisite.
											 With the present work, these two situations will be studied, considering different methodologies based either on a meshless method or

										<h3>Journal of Civil and Architecture Research - 01/11/15</h3>
										<h3>G.M.S. Bernardo, M.A.R. Loja</h3>
										<h4>Abstract:</h4>
										<p>The need for a relevant viable approach to fit point clouds obtained by 3D laser scanning, to a desirable surface, has been object of a 
											substantial research effort and progress in the past two decades and has been showed to have a special interest in civil engineering and 
											architectural fields, in the sense that could be used for heritage conservation or rehabilitation proposes. In fact, those kind of approaches 
											provides an essential advantage related with the idea that it is possible to know the real state of a structure without the need of complex or 
											expensive devices, being, as well as, unnecessary physical intervention for the propose. However, it is not so trivial to develop a trustworthy 
											and controlled approach for structure reconstruction, specially if we want to optimize it in terms of the input parameters choose. Additionally 
											it is necessary to overcome problems associated with the randomness of the 3D point cloud and the existence of undesirable information in 
											the data files. From our research, one can say that all the methods used to achieve the fitting surfaces, present different undesirable behaviours, 
											under different conditions. 
											In the present work we present a hybrid method to reconstruct the surfaces associated to synthetic point clouds randomly generated. Parametric 
											studies are carried out to illustrate and characterize the performance of the different techniques implemented.</p>

								<h2>AN EFFICIENT RBF INTERPOLATION METHOD TO RECONSTRUCT AND ANALYZE STRUCTURES REPRESENTED THROUGH UNSTRUCTURED DATA</h2>
										<h3>Proceedings of International Conference on Recent Advances in Rehabilitation and Sustainability of Structures - 02/06/15</h3>
										<h3>G.M.S. Bernardo, M.A.R. Loja</h3>
										<h4>Abstract:</h4>
										<p>The importance of focusing on the research of viable models to predict the behaviour of structures with complex geometries is an issue that is 
											growing in different scientific areas. In these cases, the research effort to find an efficient approach to fit laser scanning point clouds, 
											to the desired surface, has been increasing, leading to the possibility of modelling as built/as-is structures features. However, combining 
											the task of surface reconstruction and the implementation of a structural analysis model is not so trivial.
											First, it is important to ensure that the methods used to achieve those surfaces are compatible in the sense that the relation between the 
											acquired information data needs to be consistent to its subsequent post-processing. Although the structural engineering field is an 
											intensive research area, where a wide range of consistent and robust methods and models are available, most of them use structured input data, 
											pre-processed, which is not the case of the point cloud data as mentioned. In this work we present a method to the reconstruction of the structures 
											surfaces associated to synthetic point clouds and to its further structural analysis. The surface is reconstructed and analyzed by using an meshless 
											method. The difference between the two tasks is that the construction of the interpolants is performed using the Shepard Partition of Unity Method 
											and Wendlands CS-RBFs on the case of reconstruction, while the structural analysis uses the multiquadric RBFs. Partition Unity Method have been
											 successfully applied to solve significant surface modelling and reconstruction problems and Shepard type partition of unity functions. 
											 Additionally, this type of functions allows reproducing locally detailed surfaces with a smooth approximation in a global way. In the structural 
											 analysis part of this work, we consider that the structure can be submitted to different transversal loads. Illustrative examples and details 
											 on the formulation will be presented.</p>

									Reconstruction of Surfaces from Unstructured Points Clouds, using Compactly-Supported Radial Basis Functions</a></h2>
										<h3>Proceedings of 2nd International Conference on Numerical and Symbolic Computation - 27/03/15</h3>
										<h3>G.M.S. Bernardo, M.A.R. Loja</h3>
										<h4>Abstract:</h4>
										<p>The need for a relevant viable approach to fit point clouds obtained by 3D laser scanning, to a desirable surface, has been object of a substantial 
											research effort and progress in the past two decades in a wide range of scientific and technological fields. However, this task is far from being 
											a trivial task. First, because of the randomness of the sampled points obtained, which in most cases count with additional noise points. Secondly, 
											in point clouds it is frequent to find lacks of data, leading to the existence of holes in the surface. As far as it is possible to know, all 
											the methods used to achieve the fitting surfaces, present different undesirable behaviours, under different conditions. In the present work we 
											present a hybrid method to reconstruct the surfaces associated to synthetic point clouds randomly generated. Parametric studies are carried out

									 Optimization of structures modeled with a meshfree approach</a></h2>
										<h3>Proceedings of 6th World Congress on Nature and Biologically Inspired Computation - NaBIC14 - 01/08/14</h3>
										<h3>G.M.S. Bernardo, M.A.R. Loja</h3>
										<h4>Abstract:</h4>
										<p>Radial basis functions are being used in different scientific areas in order to reproduce the geometrical modeling of an object/structure, 
											as well as to predict its behavior. Due to its characteristics, these functions are well suited for meshfree modeling of physical quantities, which 
											for instances can be associated to the data sets of 3D laser scanning point clouds. In the present work the geometry of a structure is modeled by using 
											multiquadric radial basis functions, and its configuration is further optimized in order to obtain better performances concerning to its static and dynamic 
											behavior. For this purpose the authors consider the particle swarm optimization technique. A set of case studies is presented to illustrate the adequacy of
											 the meshfree model used, as well as its link to particle swarm optimization technique.</p>

								<h2>An integrated methodology for the reconstruction and analysis of shells structures using meshless methods</h2>
										<h3>Advances in Software Engineering - 01/08/15</h3>
										<h3>G.M.S. Bernardo, M.A.R. Loja</h3>
										<h4>Abstract:</h4>
										<p>In reverse engineering field, one acquires by some means, for instance via
											laser scanning and/or digital photography, the information that is able to
											characterize the geometry, colors and textures of an object, in order to reconstruct
											the corresponding surfaces as accurately as possible. After this reconstruction, it
											also may be needed to use that information for other purposes, which may require
											carrying on structural analyses. Although there are works focusing those different
											phases in separate, there is still an effective need to find approaches able to
											interconnect them in an efficient way. Therefore, achieving a model of as built/as-
											is structures conditions, able to be subsequently submitted to a structural analysis
											in a similar based platform is a fundamental step to establish an effective
											expeditious processing workflow. With the present work a methodology based on
											the use of meshless approaches is proposed to reconstruct shells described by
											points’ clouds, and to subsequently predict their static behavior. Details on the
											formulation, and illustrative examples focusing cylindrical and double-curvature
											shells, are presented.</p>
